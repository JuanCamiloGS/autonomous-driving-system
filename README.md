# autonomous-driving-system

A system of autonomous driving for a car in a driving simulator, developed to be able to drive in tracks with different characteristics and react to other vehicles in the track during the driving process. This system is composed of a neural network to determine the steering and a fuzzy logic model controlling the brake and accelerator. It has a graphical interface where the inputs and outputs of the system are shown as well as the defuzzification process of the fuzzy system. TORCS (The Open Racing Car Simulator) is used as the simulation software. This is an open source tool widely used for research projects related to artificial intelligence due to its realistic modeling of the car's physical dynamic, the possibility to access the source code of the simulator and the ease to stablish a communication protocol between TORCS and an intelligent algorithm developed in programming languages like Python.
